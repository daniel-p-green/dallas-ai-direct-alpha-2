# Progress Log

Task: Project: Dallas AI Direct Alpha. Task: Create a minimal brand implementation package using Vercel Geist brand guidelines and icons for demo-facing assets.
Started: 2026-02-12 03:02 America/Chicago

## Codebase Patterns
- This repository currently stores product and technical deliverables as Markdown-first artifacts under `docs/` and `tests/`.
- Validation for documentation stories can be implemented as lightweight shell checks in `tests/` when no package scripts exist.

## 2026-02-12 03:03 America/Chicago - US-001: Create Geist-aligned brand guidelines document
- Implemented `docs/brand-guidelines.md` with required sections: typography, spacing, color usage, icon rules, and accessibility guardrails.
- Added explicit privacy guardrail that attendee email never appears in public-facing UI.
- Added explicit non-endorsement wording: Geist-style conventions are referenced without claiming official Vercel endorsement.
- Added documentation test assets: `tests/brand-guidelines-tests.md` and `tests/validate-brand-guidelines.sh`.
- **Learnings:** The repo does not currently define npm scripts for build/test/typecheck, so doc validation is performed with direct shell checks.
