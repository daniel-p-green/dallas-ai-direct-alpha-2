# Dallas AI Direct – Alpha

Reference implementation for a governed, community-owned attendee directory built for live events.

---

## Executive Summary

Dallas AI Direct Alpha addresses a concrete operating constraint: dependency on paid third-party attendee directory access. Dallas AI has 10,000+ members, and at 10% paid participation with $3 to $5 annual pricing, this represents an estimated $36,000 to $60,000 annualized cost exposure. This project demonstrates a lower-cost, governed alternative that preserves participant trust. The architecture enforces access at the database boundary with Neon Postgres RLS and a projection view (`attendees_public`) that excludes email from public reads. The design uses explicit consent for optional profile visibility and keeps sensitive data private by default. The live demo proves a simple hero moment: QR signup in about 30 seconds, room board update within 5 seconds, and no public email exposure. This repository demonstrates a repeatable AI Infrastructure Sprint pattern that delivers a working artifact in hours, not a slide deck.

## Business Constraint and ROI

### Constraint
Teams rely on third-party directory access to understand event participation in real time.

### Economic impact

| Input | Value |
| --- | ---: |
| Member base | 10,000+ |
| Paying share assumption | 10% |
| Price per paying member (annual) | $3 to $5 |
| Annualized exposure | $36,000 to $60,000 |

### What changed economically?

- Replaced recurring access dependency with owned infrastructure.
- Reduced exposure to vendor policy and pricing changes.
- Improved governance over sensitive attendee data.
- Enabled faster iteration under direct team control.
- Created a reusable sprint model for future revenue workflows.

## Hero Moment

Attendees scan a QR code, submit in about 30 seconds, and appear on the room board within 5 seconds. The board reads only public-safe fields. Email never appears on public surfaces. Database boundary controls enforce the policy even if UI behavior changes.

## Architecture Overview

```text
Client (QR + Browser)

        v
API Route (Validated Insert)
        |
        v
Neon Postgres
        |
        v
RLS (Deny by Default)

        v
attendees_public View
        |
        v
Room Board (Polling every 5s)
```

### Why this architecture

- Enforces access where data lives, not where rendering happens.
- Uses projection boundary (`attendees_public`) to prevent email leakage.
- Separates base table writes from public reads.
- Uses polling over realtime for demo reliability and lower operational variance.

---

## Data Model and Consent Design

### Core fields

- Required: `name`, `email`, `ai_comfort_level`, `help_needed`, `help_offered`
- Optional: `linkedin_url`, `title`, `company`, `other_help_needed`, `other_help_offered`
- Consent flag: `display_title_company` (default `false`)

### Design principles in data model

- **Least privilege:** public UI reads from projection only.
- **Projection boundary:** `attendees_public` excludes sensitive/private fields.
- **Explicit consent:** title/company display requires opt-in.
- **Sensitive-by-default:** email remains private across public flows.

---

## Security Posture

### 1) Database controls

- RLS enabled and forced on sensitive table.
- Deny-by-default select posture on base table.
- Unique index on normalized email.
- Check constraints for ranges and field limits.
- Public projection view excludes email.

### 2) Application controls

- Honeypot field for low-effort bot filtering.
- Server-side validation for payload shape and bounds.
- Optional throttling strategy for burst abuse.
- Escaped rendering to reduce injection risk.

### 3) STRIDE summary

| Threat | Primary mitigation | Residual risk |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Spoofing | Honeypot + validation | Moderate in anonymous alpha |
| Tampering | Server validation + DB constraints | Low to moderate |
| Repudiation | Event logs + timestamps | Moderate |
| Information disclosure | RLS + `attendees_public` boundary | Low if controls stay enforced |
| Denial of service | Throttling + fallback mode | Moderate under hostile traffic |
| Elevation of privilege | No public base-table reads | Low to moderate |

## Runtime Validation Discipline

Pre-demo runtime validation is a release gate.

- Preflight SQL checks for table/view access behavior
- Email non-exposure verification in payload and UI
- Duplicate insert rejection check
- Comfort-level bounds check
- XSS rendering sanity check
- Mobile QR sanity checklist for iPhone Safari and Android Chrome

Go/No-Go requires all privacy and boundary checks to pass.

## Why this is not just a directory

This implementation acts as a projection-bound identity and capability mapping layer. It demonstrates a reusable pattern for governed AI-enabled workflows inside organizations. The value is not the UI alone. The value is constraint removal with enforceable controls.

## AI Infrastructure Sprint Model

1. Constraint mapping
2. Architecture and governance design
3. Working alpha delivery
4. ROI framing and roadmap handoff

This sprint produces a working artifact, not a slide deck.

## Setup Overview (High level)

### Stack

- Next.js
- Neon Postgres
- Postgres RLS policies

### Environment variables

- `NEON_DATABASE_URL` (server-side only)
- `NEON_DATABASE_URL_POOLED` (server-side only, optional)
- `NEON_DATABASE_URL_READONLY` (server-side only, optional)

### Setup outline

1. Provision Neon project.
2. Apply schema and RLS docs.
3. Start app locally.
4. Run runtime validation checks.

- `docs/data-model.md`
- `docs/rls-policies.md`

## Design Principles

- Enforce access at the database boundary.
- Never expose sensitive fields on public surfaces.
- Prefer reliability over flash.
- Build the smallest system that proves constraint removal.
- Make consent explicit and default-safe.
- Keep operational knobs separate from reference artifacts.

---

## What we deliberately did not do

- No OAuth/SSO flows in alpha.
- No realtime subscription dependency for demo path.
- No marketing or compliance claims.
- No schema overreach beyond current constraint.
- No dependency expansion outside core stack.

---

## Repository Navigation

- `docs/` architecture, security, policy, runbooks
- `tests/` validation plans and smoke checks
- `ops/` operational checklists and incident guidance
- `prompts/v0/` deterministic UI build orchestration
- `v0-build/` isolated non-code context + brand pack + target workspace for v0-generated build output

## Design System

For demo-facing UI, use the minimal design system package:
- `docs/brand-guidelines.md`
- `docs/ui-patterns.md`
- `docs/assets.md`

Brand implementation rule:
- Dallas AI logo assets in `public/brand/` are required on shared demo shell and hero-facing surfaces.

## Closing

This repository demonstrates how to replace vague AI readiness discussions with a governed, working system in hours.

We build this pattern inside organizations around revenue constraints.
