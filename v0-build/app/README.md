# v0 App Output Directory

Place v0-generated application code in this directory.

## Rules

- Keep all generated pages, components, and styles inside `v0-build/app/`.
- Keep public room reads constrained to `attendees_public`.
- Keep attendee `email` private on public surfaces.
- Keep Dallas AI logo integrated in shared shell and hero surfaces.

## Skills used

- Source scan attempted: `~/.codex/skills` (directory not present in current environment)
- Applied: repository root standards from `agents.md`
