# Brand and Visual Requirements for v0 Build

## Brand direction

Build a Dallas AI-first interface. Use Geist-style implementation conventions to support clarity and consistency. Do not let framework styling overshadow Dallas AI brand identity.

## Approved logo assets

| Asset | Path | Use case |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Dallas AI color logo | `v0-build/brand/dallas-ai-logo-color.png` | light backgrounds |
| Dallas AI white logo | `v0-build/brand/dallas-ai-logo-white.png` | dark backgrounds |

## Required placements

| Surface | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| Shared shell header | Show Dallas AI color logo on light surfaces |
| Hero section | Show Dallas AI logo above headline or in top lockup |
| Public board shell | Keep Dallas AI logo visible in shell chrome |

## Logo usage constraints

- Keep original logo aspect ratio.
- Keep minimum width at 120px desktop and 96px mobile.
- Keep at least 16px clear space around logo lockup.
- Do not add effects, shadows, gradients, or recolors to logo files.

## Typography and color posture

- Use neutral-first system with high contrast and strong projector readability.
- Keep headline and CTA hierarchy clear and concise.
- Keep active voice and enterprise tone in all visible copy.

## Misuse rules

- Do not remove Dallas AI logo from primary demo surfaces.
- Do not present Vercel or Geist as official product sponsor or endorser.
- Do not use third-party logos as primary brand marks.

## Skills used
