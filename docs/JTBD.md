# Jobs To Be Done

## Organizer Jobs
- When I run a live talk, I want to see who joined in real time so I can tailor Q and A.
- When I present to security-minded audiences, I want to prove privacy controls so I can earn trust.

## Attendee Jobs
- When I scan a QR code, I want a fast signup so I can participate immediately.
- When I share my info, I want my email protected so I stay in control of my privacy.

## CISO Jobs
- When I review this system, I want explicit backend controls and test evidence so I can assess risk quickly.

## Skills used

- Scanned `~/.codex/skills` and found `antfarm-workflows/SKILL.md`.
