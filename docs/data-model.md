# Data model

## Table: `attendees`

| Column | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | `uuid` pk | generated by db |
| `created_at` | `timestamptz` | default `now()` |
| `name` | `text` | required |
| `title` | `text` | optional |
| `company` | `text` | optional |
| `linkedin_url` | `text` | optional, URL format |
| `email` | `text` | required, sensitive |
| `ai_comfort_level` | `text` | validated enum-like values |
| `help_needed` | `text[]` | multi-select plus Other |
| `help_offered` | `text[]` | multi-select plus Other |
| `honeypot` | `text` | bot trap, must remain empty |

## Public projection: `attendees_public`

Use `attendees_public` for directory reads.

- Include only public-safe fields.
- Exclude `email`, `honeypot`, and private notes.
- Keep UI and API contract pinned to this view.

## Read/write pattern for alpha

- Inserts go to `attendees`.
- Directory reads come from `attendees_public` only.

- No Supabase data-model skill exists there today, so this file applies
  repository data-minimization standards directly.
